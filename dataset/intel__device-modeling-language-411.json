  "problem_statement": "**Problem Statement:**\n\nThe documentation contains a typo and inconsistent formatting. In `README.md`, the DMLC_DIR section uses \"build compiler\" instead of \"built compiler\", which is grammatically incorrect. In `py/README.md`, the title uses inconsistent capitalization (\"A short hacking guide to dmlc\" instead of title case), and the introductory sentence is wordy and unclear. These issues reduce clarity and professionalism.",
